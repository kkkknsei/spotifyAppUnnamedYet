# spotifyAppUnnamedYet
This is, basically, my main project since I started coding for real. As I was finishing Harvard's CS50, my final project became this application: it's a web scraper for AOTY.org, a website that compiles lists of albums (on a "best albums of the year" kind). After it scraps the pages for info about the albums, i'll create a playlist on spotify with 4 random tracks from each album on the list. The goal is to help people out on listening the best albuns of the year according to a specific source and/or list (like "Rolling Stone", "Pitchfork" and/or "The Needle Drop" picks or lists).
